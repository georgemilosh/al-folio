We are looking for Postdoctoral Researcher within the HELIOSKILL project, initiative aimed at solving one of the most intriguing mysteries in space physics: the heating of the solar wind. The HELIOSKILL project, supported by data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions, seeks to derive the equation of state for the expanding solar wind using high-resolution kinetic simulations and machine learning techniques. The PI for this project is [Prof. Ronny Keppens](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541/).
 
We are looking for candidates with a Ph.D. in Plasma Physics, Astrophysics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, or related fields. Ideal candidates will have experience with two of these: kinetic plasma simulations, data analysis from space missions, machine learning, and high-performance computing.
 
Responsibilities include:
 
* Analyzing data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions.
* Developing machine learning techniques to extract solar wind thermodynamics.
* Conducting high-resolution simulations and integrating them with observational data.
* Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team and contributing to publications and conferences.
 
The initial position is for 2 years, with funding available for a one-year extension. This role offers a unique opportunity to contribute to high-impact research at the [Centre of mathematical Plasma Astrophysics (CmPA)](https://wis.kuleuven.be/CmPA) at KU Leuven. To apply follow the [official webpage](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/60377797?lang=en) which has more detailed description of the project.
