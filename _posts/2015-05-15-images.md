    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

In this post I discuss how I made the figures that won the third place for [visualization of science contest](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/visualizing-science-2016) at the University of Texas at Austin where I did my PhD. The image is based on research produced many years ago on Nontwist maps by del-Castillo-Negrete and Morrison. These maps were developed to describe discretized low-dimensional dynamics that preserves areas under transformation and violates the so-called `twist condition` (see equation \eqref{eq:twist}). For more details on mathematical and physical properties see a review on [Scholarpedia.](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Nontwist_maps). The model is rather abstract but it aims to provide understanding for chaotic transport and quasi-integrable systems. The equations descrbing the Standard Nontwist Map (SNM) are as follows

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
