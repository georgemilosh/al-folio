This is an example post with image galleries.

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/8.jpg class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable: true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/10.jpg class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable: true %}
    </div>
</div>
