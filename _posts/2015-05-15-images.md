In this post I discuss how I made the figures that won the third place for visualization of science contest at the University of Texas at Austin where I did my PhD. The image is based on research produced many years ago on Nontwist maps by del-Castillo-Negrete and Morrison. These maps were developed to describe discretized low-dimensional dynamics that preserves areas under transformation and violates the so-called `twist condition` (see equation \eqref{eq:twist}). For more details on mathematical and physical properties see a review on [Scholarpedia.](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Nontwist_maps)

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\overline{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{x}+\mathrm{a}\left(1-\overline{\mathrm{y}}^2\right), \quad(\text { modulo } 1) \\
&\overline{\mathrm{y}}=\mathrm{y}-\mathrm{b} \sin (2 \pi \mathrm{x})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}\label{eq:twist}
\frac{\partial \overline{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})}{\partial \mathrm{y}} \geq \mathrm{c}>0 \quad \forall(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.


This is an example post with image galleries.

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/Standardnontwistmaplowres.png title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable: true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/snm615_4_tlowres.png title: "example image" class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable: true %}
    </div>
</div>

These diagrams can be created in wolfram mathematica
