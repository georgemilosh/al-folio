Working in climate science has been an interesting journey. Typically, one runs into meteorologists, oceanographers, and geophysicists in this field. It is a field that is extraordinary in that communication and societal impact plays a crucial role. This, in our polarized world, unfortunately leads to a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding: from complete denial to extreme alarmism. As someone who has worked on climate science related topics for 3 years, I will try to give my honest take on climate. I am not currently involved in Earth system models, but I have had a pleasure to interact with these people. So what is the state of climate, and where are we going? What are the counter-intuitive mechanisms of climate change, and what can we do about it? How much worried should we be and what is helpful to do?

## What's the problem doc?

The figure below comes from [Copernicus](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/copernicus-ecmwf_our-data-confirms-that-22-july-2024-was-the-activity-7222497119964659713-DXnG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop){:target="\_blank"} and shows the trends in temperature change. It illustrates vividly that the last two years have been indeed exceptional.

It should be noted that there are three factors that potentially explain this anomaly and they will be covered in the following section.


## What is climate?

Climate corresponds to the long-term average of weather. Weather is the day-to-day state of the atmosphere, while climate is the average of weather over a long period of time. Climate is a complex system that is influenced by both natural factors and human activities. Many of the processes take time on different scales, such as decades, centuries, millennia, and even longer. Climate change can have a wide range of impacts on the environment, including global and local changes in average temperature, sea levels, frequency or severity of precipitation patterns and storms.

## Is climate predictable?

The Earth system including oceans, atmosphere and soil is chaotic, which means that it is sensitive to initial conditions and small changes in the system can lead to large changes in the outcome. This is why weather forecasts are only accurate for a few days. However, climate is a statistical quantity, and it is possible to make predictions about the long-term average of weather. What emerges is that climate is less predictable on the scale of years, becomes somewhat predictable on the scale of decades and more predictable on the scale of centuries. This statement has to be qualified as here I am talking about linear response of the climate system. There are many non-linear processes in the climate system that can lead to abrupt changes, such as the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that I will talk about later.

## What causes climate change?

Climate change can be caused by natural factors, such as volcanic eruptions and solar radiation, or by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Crucial thing to understand about the energy balance of Earth is that while it is primarily driven by the sun, much of the energy reaching the Earth is absorbed by the surface and then re-radiated as heat. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap some of this heat, preventing it from escaping into space. The classic question is how much does the average temperature change if we double the amount of CO2 which is one of the primary greenhouse gases. Simple calculations of radiative transfer in the column of atmosphere show that the direct effect of CO2 would only explain a third of the observed warming. So where does the rest come from? 

To understand another 1/3 we have to remind ourselves that from thermodynamics we know that increasing the temperature of the air allows it to hold more moisture: water vapor is also a very potent greenhouse gas, in fact, more so than CO2. But the atmosphere has a natural way of getting rid of it if there is too much, while CO2 must be sequestered through biomass/ocean acidification or other chemical processes. Some of these processes take much longer, thus making the problem of stray CO2 so acute. Thus, CO2 increases temperature by trapping heat, allowing the air to hold more water vapor further increasing temperature. There actually an optimal amount for a given amount of CO2 thus we can say that water vapor feedback leads to 1/3 more warming than one would expect simply from CO2. No one in scientific literature disputes these 2/3 of warming. There is also ice-albedo feedback which is a positive feedback mechanism: as the ice melts, the Earth's surface becomes darker, absorbing more heat and causing more ice to melt. This leads to much faster warming of the poles compared to equatorial regions which is observed.

The situation becomes much more complicated once we factor in the clouds and aerosols. Clouds can both reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth, and trap heat, warming the Earth. The net effect of clouds, especially in future warmer atmosphere, is still not well understood. Indeed, clouds are the main source of uncertainty in climate models and the climate scientists are quite open about this. Nevertheless, most climate scientists agree that the net effect of clouds on global warming is likely positive.

Notice that in addition we observe the sun very carefully, and we know that Earth's warming is not due it. The climate science makes a prediction that the warming must occur in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), while the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) must cool. This is exactly what we observe. Many of the global predictions of climate change and some regional predictions have been confirmed by observations, which is a strong evidence that the basic mechanism described here forms a consistent theory of climate change. When we talk of theory in science (rather than hypothesis) we mean a set of ideas that are consistent internally as well as with all the observations and experiments. Now that is not to say that there are no uncertainties in climate science.

## What do we not know for sure?

IPCC reports are an attempt to provide detailed information and quantify uncertainties in the projections. They attempt to provide meta-analysis of the scientific literature to provide the most reliable assessment of the expert panel about the state of the climate and its likely evolution that could be useful for the policymakers. IPCC reports also make regional projections, for instance about the state of future climate in areas such as South- East Asia where many of the areas are projected to become unlivable due to heat stress. Such circumstances could lead to massive migration which could be destabilizing. Also, attention is paid to changes in precipitation patterns, which could lead to droughts and floods. The reports also discuss the impact of climate change on biodiversity, agriculture, and human health: adaptation and mitigation. 

As mentioned earlier, while major trends such as linear response of the climate system to the CO2 driving are understood, there are some wild cards, if you will, which may have significant impact, but we don't know if and especially when they will happen. One such wild card is Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which is a large system of ocean currents that transports warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic. The AMOC is driven by differences in temperature and salinity, and it plays a crucial role in regulating the climate of Europe. The AMOC has been weakening in recent years, and there is some evidence that it may be close to a tipping point where it could collapse. If the AMOC were to collapse, it could lead to a rapid and severe cooling of Europe, which would have major impacts on agriculture, energy production. The consensus of climate scientists is that the collapse of AMOC is unlikely in this century, but it is not impossible and there are routinely pre-prints on arXiv that discuss this possibility even before the year 2050. 

## Can we blame oil industry for hurricane Katrina?

Another buzzword that is commonly discussed in the climate outreach is extreme events. Events such as AMOC are difficult to ascertain because many of the relevant processes are not included in models. On the other hand, extreme events such as heatwaves routinely occur and clearly display increasing frequency. It is not hard to make even causal connection between the warming of the Earth and the increased frequency of heatwaves. However, it is much harder to make a causal connection between the warming of the Earth and a particular hurricane. The reason is that hurricanes are complex systems that depend on many factors, such as sea surface temperature, wind shear, and atmospheric moisture. While it is true that warmer oceans can lead to more intense hurricanes, it is difficult to say that a particular hurricane was caused by climate change. This is why the IPCC reports are careful to say that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of some extreme, but it is difficult to say that a particular one was caused by climate change. Also, we should note that the definition of the extreme event (e.g. what is a heatwave) is not always clear and can be subjective. Typically, some threshold is chosen, however it might be that if we were to choose a different threshold we would get a completely different result. What makes things even more complex is that the impact of extreme events is not only determined by the event itself, but also by the vulnerability of the population and the infrastructure. To give an example, California has been experiencing droughts recently, as well as wildfires. While the droughts are likely to be caused by climate change, the wildfires are also caused by the fact that in California people are increasingly building houses in areas that are prone to wildfires and that for about century or so the policy has been to suppress fires which has led to accumulation of forest fuel thus leading to uncontrollable fires.

## Is it only global warming to blame?

 We record exceptional loss of biodiversity. Climate change will become a major factor in the loss of biodiversity. One of the recent effects that had an impact on biodiversity is the coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is caused by the warming of the oceans, which can lead to the death of the coral reefs. Coral reefs are important ecosystems that provide habitat for many species of fish and other marine life, and their loss can have a major impact on the health of the oceans. 

Nevertheless, at the moment the primary cause of this loss is habitat destruction, which is caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture. Thus, even if we were to curb emissions today, we would still have to deal with the loss of biodiversity. That does not however mean that we should not curb emissions. 

## What about the anomalous temperature 2023-2024?

The figure above shows that the last two years have been exceptional. There are three factors that potentially explain this anomaly. The first factor is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a natural climate pattern that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean. During an El Niño event, the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, which can lead to changes in weather patterns around the world. The second factor is the overall warming trend which we talked about above. The third factor is interesting because it is potentially related to the unusually warm Atlantic ocean temperature in 2023 and specifically the cause behind this, which is believed to be reduction in man-made aerosols. There were some regulations that were put in place to curb emissions by ship industry, and some scientists believe that the resulting reduction in aerosols blocked less sunlight that was able to reach the ocean and thus lead to access heat. This is interesting, because overall concern about pollution may have lead to this unintended effect. However, it is important to note that the extent of the warming in 2023-2024 is still being studied, and it is not yet fully understood.
