**NOTE:**
This blog post contains discussions we had with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).


## ChatGPT overview

<blockquote>
    A curse of science, dark catalysis doth harness the power of the shadows, turning them into a force for ill. When a substance is shielded from the radiance of the sun, it doth absorb the energy of the darkness, causing chemical reactions to occur. These reactions can create harmful substances, contaminating the air and water and making them polluted and toxic once more. A horror to behold, dark catalysis doth bring the ugliness of nature and the horrors of science together, working in disharmony to ruin the world.
    —Chat GPT3 when prompted to ``produce an opposite text to a description of photocatalysis in the style of Shakespeare''

 Of course, I could have generated a prompt to let [Chat GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) explain itself, so the reader is welcome to do that themselves. I am assuming that the reader is familiar with Chat GPT (which has public access as of now). If not, check out this website [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). The important point to retain is that it is based on attention mechanism of [transformers](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-89034557de14) that are fine-tuned with the help of user judges based on a technique called [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) to generate more reliable responses and eliminate apparent bias and harmful content. The public release of ChatGPT attracted widespread interest with a mix of awe, surprise and criticism. In this blog post our goals are to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT, after testing its responses for several weeks after the release.




## Magnetic reconnection

**Note:** Below we will give more clear explanation 

## Photocatalysis
