Below I list various sources that I found myself or through friends for people wishing to follow `pedagogical tutorials` on modern `deep learning` techniques.  

## General resources

This is is quite nice but targets french speakers: [CNRS-Fidle](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/talks/fidle){:target="\_blank"}. They cover the basics and the modern tools of machine learning from A to Z with practical exercises and offerring a convenient docker or an option to use personal python environment. They also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CNRS-FIDLE) with all the lectures.

## Transformers

[A gentle introduction](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/){:target="\_blank"} by Jay Alammar into how multi-head self-attention mechanism was implemented in the original paper on transformers. The jupyter notebook that is available is a bit dated since it is based on `tensorflow 1`. You will find other useful links in this introduction such as pytorch anotated code that goes with the famous article [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

This course on [Natural Language Processing](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) is recommended if you want practical tips on how to pick up pre-trained transformers from `Hugging Face` ðŸ¤— repository and fine-tune them for your downstream task. 

## Diffusion models

A success of AI art such as DALL-E and Midjourney have made headlines. But what are they based on? Find out more about probabilistic denoising diffusion models:
- I really recommend the following repository for people who are interested in Langevin dynamics (which is at the heart of diffusion models), a tutorial by Prof. F. Rousseau on Diffusion Models: [part A](https://youtu.be/L6Ig_-ARtuo), [part B](https://youtu.be/2KXsNkkZmYk) supplied with a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/CIA-Oceanix/ai4oac2023/tree/main/tutorial_DiffModel).
- Materials from the ðŸ¤— [Huggingface Diffusion Models course](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/tree/main) have been recommended to me by [Redouane Lguensat](https://redouanelg.github.io/).


## Tutorials for physics applications

[ECMWF Mood on AI in Weather and Climate](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate). An ecxellent introduction for Earth science practitioners willing to dive in to how geophysicists apply machine learning to their domain. From statistichal post-processing of weather forecasts to physics-guided data-driven parametrizations of climate.

This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157319300766) is also a bit dated now, but offers a brief intro to Machine Learning to Physicists.
