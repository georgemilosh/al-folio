### Machine Learning

I am involved currently in **Machine learning**, which is becoming a _maintstream_ tool for data analysis in various fields of science and engineering.

My interests include 
1. Neural networks
2. Modeling of physical systems, such as extreme events in climate
3. Turbulence in plasmas and fluids and statistical physics
4. Here is an image of a standard nontwist map that I made during my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin. It won a third place in a visualizing science contest!
