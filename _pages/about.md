## Short Summary

I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) working on the interface between plasma physics and scientific machine learning (ML): [Project STRIDE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101148539) aims to improve representation of particle effects in plasma fluid and hybrid models using neural networks and symbolic regression trained on high-fidelity particle simulations.

I am also project manager of [ASAP](https://asap-space.eu/), a project that aims to develop the AI algorithms and the required software/hardware to be deployed onboard of space missions in order to facilitate and improve space science and exploration. This includes the development of AI algorithms for autonomous data analysis, and data compression onboard of space missions.

My research interests:

- Machine learning for space weather and space plasmas
- Physics-informed machine learning
- Extreme events in environmental data science
- Turbulence and reconnection in plasmas

My PhD from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) was on the effects of microscopic kinetic effects in turbulent plasmas, relying on analytical and numerical simulations. In the last three years I have enriched my experience by working on environmental data science with the focus on extreme events.  Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including statistics and nonlinear dynamics. 

Originally I come from a small country, nestled in Caucasus. Growing up in a diverse family, I have always enjoyed and appreciated multicultural settings.
