## Short Summary

I am a physicist who applies *machine learning* to solve problems in physics. My PhD from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) was in analytical and numerical methods for turbulent fluid models of plasma with special attention payed to conservation laws and symmetries. I applied such models and performed  `numerical simulations` to understand the effects of microscopic fluctuations on macroscopic structures in turbulent cascades . In the last three years I have enriched my experience by working on data-driven prediction of extreme events in climate science.  Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including turbulence, statistics and nonlinear dynamics. 

Originally I come from a small country, nestled in Caucasus and growing up in a diverse family, I have always enjoyed and appreciated multicultural settings. 

This fall I am starting a postdoc at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) in a group of [Giovanni Lapenta](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00052182). Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better prediction and understanding of *solar flares* in space weather using deep learning approaches. Events that are rare present challenges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have societal impact. In many of these fields forecasting of the events happen both with `physics-based models` that are computationally expensive. A competitive approach is to rely on machine learning only. However, this poses a risk of overfitting to specific conditions which could change

### Data driven closure

A promising approach is to learn adaptable closures which are `physics-based models` that combine `data-driven` component such parametrization in a way that generalizes better if conservational laws are respected
