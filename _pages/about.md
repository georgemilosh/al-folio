## Short Summary

I am a physicist involved in the interface between *machine learning* and physics. I work in complex systems such as plasma physics and geophysics with methods ranging from analytical theory to `numerical simulations` to data analaysis and `machine learning`. Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including turbulence, statistical physics, and mathematical physics.

I got my PhD degree from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu). I am a postdoc at [La Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l'Environement](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr) at CEA Saclay working in a group of Pascal Yiou. Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better understanding of *extreme events* in climate using satistics and deep learning. 

### Extreme events

Events that are rare present challanges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have sociatal impact. Such events may include

1. Heat waves and cold spells
2. More generally tipping points in climate
3. Coronal mass ejections
4. Tokamak disruptions

### Machine Learning

I am involved currently in **Machine learning**, which is becoming a _maintstream_ tool in various fields of science and engineering. My intersts include

1. Machine learning in physics related fields
2. Physics based constraints in neural networks
