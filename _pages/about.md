## Short Summary

I am a physicist involved in the interface between *machine learning* and complex systems such as climate, geophysics, plasma physics, solar wind. I am a postdoc at École normale supérieure de Lyon working in a group of Freddy Bouchet. Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better understanding of *extreme events* in climate. Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including turbulence, statistical physics, systems with long-range interactions, plasma physics and mathematical physics.

### Extreme events

Events that are rare present challanges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have sociatal impact. Such events may include

1. Heat waves and cold spells
2. More generally tipping points in climate
3. Coronal mass ejetctions
4. Tokamak disruptions

### Machine Learning

I am involved currently in **Machine learning**, which is becoming a _maintstream_ tool in various fields of science and engineering. My intersts include

1. Deep neural networks
2. Physically inspired neural networks
