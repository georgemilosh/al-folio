## Short Summary

I am a physicist involved in the interface between *machine learning* and physics. I work in complex systems such as plasma physics and geophysics with methods ranging from analytical theory to `numerical simulations` to data analysis and `deep learning`. Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including turbulence, statistics and mathematical physics. I got my PhD degree from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu). But originally I come from a small country, nestled in Caucasus and growing up in a diverse family, I have always enjoyed and appreciated multicultural settings. 

This fall I am starting a postdoc at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) in a group of [Giovanni Lapenta](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00052182). Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better prediction and understanding of *solar flares* in space weather using machine learning techniques such as `Variational autoencoders`. 

### Extreme events

Events that are rare present challenges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have societal impact. Such events may include:

1. Solar flares, geomagnetic storms and sub-storms
2. Tokamak disruptions, fusion science
3. Reversal of dynamo, Earth's geomagnetism
4. Climate and weather extremes such as heatwaves and coldspells, tropical cyclones

In many of these fields forecasting of the events happen both with `physics-based models` that are computationally expensive. A competitive approach is to rely on machine learning only. However, this poses a risk of overfitting to specific conditions which could change

### Data driven closure

A promising approach is to learn adaptable closures which are `physics-based models` that combine `data-driven` component such parametrization in a way that generalizes better if conservational laws are respected
