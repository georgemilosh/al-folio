## Short Summary

I am a physicist working on the interface between plasma logistics and scientific `machine learning`. My PhD from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) was on the effects of microscopic physics in turbulent plasmas, relying on analytical and numerical simulations. In the last three years I have enriched my experience by working on data-driven prediction of extreme events in climate science.  Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including statistics and nonlinear dynamics. 

Originally I come from a small country, nestled in Caucasus and growing up in a diverse family, I have always enjoyed and appreciated multicultural settings. 

This fall I have started a postdoc at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) in a group of [Giovanni Lapenta](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00052182). My main project is on improving forecasting of space weaher events with machine learning. Currently I am working with three master and one PhD student. Together we are working on reduced order modelling via [equation discovery](https://towardsdatascience.com/on-data-driven-equation-discovery-5069795d239d) metods and deep learning approaches. 


Events that are rare present challenges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have societal impact. In many of these fields forecasting of the events happen both with `physics-based models` that are computationally expensive. A competitive approach is to rely on machine learning only. To improve the reliability and generalisability it could be advantages to merge physics based models with machine learning. 

### Data-driven closure

A promising approach is to learn adaptable closures which are `physics-based models` that combine `data-driven` component such parametrization in a way that generalizes better if conservational laws are respected
