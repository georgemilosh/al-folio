## Short Summary

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Currently, I am a postdoc at [La Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l'Environement](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr) at CEA Saclay working in a group of Pascal Yiou. Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better sampling and understanding of *extreme events* in climate using statistical methods like `Markov chains` and deep learning. 

### Extreme events

Events that are rare present challanges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have societal impact. Such events may include:

1. `Heat waves` and cold spells
2. More generally tipping points in climate
3. Reversal of dynamo
3. Coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic activity
4. Tokamak disruptions, Fusion science

In many of these fields forecasting of the events happen both with `physics-based models` that are computationally expensive. A competetive approach is to rely on machine learning (broadly speaking). The hope is that we will find a way to combine the two approaches, which is an area of intense research, currently.

### Machine Learning

I am involved currently in **Machine learning**, which is becoming a _maintstream_ tool in various fields of science and engineering. My intersts include

1. Machine learning in physics related fields
2. `Physics based constraints` in neural networks

These are also topics related to subgrid parametrizations and energy/momentum conserving schemes.
