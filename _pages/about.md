## Short Summary

I am a physicist involved in the interface between *machine learning* and physics. I work in complex systems such as plasma physics and geophysics with methods ranging from analytical theory to `numerical simulations` to data analaysis and `deep learning`. Throughout my career I have been involved in various subjects including turbulence, statistical physics, and mathematical physics. I got my PhD degree from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu). I come from a small country nestled in Caucausus, and due to my mixed upbringing have been often exposed to multicultural environment, which I always welcomed. 

Currently, I am a postdoc at [La Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l'Environement](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr) at CEA Saclay working in a group of Pascal Yiou. Together we are involved in a project which aims to provide better sampling and understanding of *extreme events* in climate using statistical methods like `Markov chains` and deep learning. 

### Extreme events

Events that are rare present challanges, since they are hard to measure or estimate, yet they may have societal impact. Such events may include:

1. `Heat waves` and cold spells
2. More generally tipping points in climate
3. Reversal of dynamo
3. Coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic activity
4. Tokamak disruptions, Fusion science

In many of these fields forecasting of the events happen both with `physics-based models` that are computationally expensive. A competetive approach is to rely on machine learning (broadly speaking). The hope is that we will find a way to combine the two approaches, which is an area of intense research, currently.

### Machine Learning

I am involved currently in **Machine learning**, which is becoming a _maintstream_ tool in various fields of science and engineering. My intersts include

1. Machine learning in physics related fields
2. `Physics based constraints` in neural networks

These are also topics related to subgrid parametrizations and energy/momentum conserving schemes.
