At the time (around 2011-2012) I was a big fan of [Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) which is an educational website that has grown ever since. At the time it was available only in English so I translated a couple of videos to russian. One is on solving inequalities and the other one is on Newton's third law.
