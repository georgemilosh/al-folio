  abstract={One of the big challenges today is to appropriately describe heat waves, which are relevant due to their impact on human society. Common characteristics in mid-latitudes involve meanders of the westerly flow and concomitant large anticyclonic anomalies of the geopotential field. These anomalies form the so-called teleconnection patterns, and thus it is natural to ask how robust such structures are in various models and how much data we require to make statistically significant inferences. In addition, it is natural to ask what are the precursor phenomena that would improve forecasting capabilities of the heat waves. In particular, what kind of long term effect does the soil moisture have and how it compares to the respective quantitative contribution to the predictability of the teleconnection patterns. In order to answer these questions we perform various types of regression on a climate model. We construct the composite maps of the geopotential height at 500 hPa and estimate return times of heatwaves of different severity. Of particular interest to us is a committor function, which is essentially a probability a heat wave occurs given the current state of the system. Committor functions can be efficiently computed using the analogue method, which involves learning a Markov chain that produces synthetic trajectories from the real trajectories. Alternatively they can be estimated using machine learning approach. Finally we compare the composite maps in real dynamics to the ones generated by the Markov chain and observe how well the rare events are sampled, for instance to allow extending the return time plots.},
