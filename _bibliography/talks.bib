  abstract = {Sampling rare events such as extreme heatwaves whose return period is larger than the length of available observations requires developing and benchmarking new  simulation methods. There is growing interest in applying deep learning alongside already existing statistical approaches to better generate and predict rare events. Our goal is to benchmark Stochastic Weather Generator (SWG) [1] based on analogs of circulation, soil moisture and temperature as a tool for sampling tails of distribution as well as forecasting heatwaves in France and Scandinavia using data from General Circulation Model (GCM). Analog method has been successfully implemented in rare event algorithms for low dimensional climate models [2]. SWG is implemented using a Markov chain with hidden states (.e.g. geopotential height at 500 hPa) with Euclidean metric. When applying such methods to climate data two challenges emerge: a large number of degrees of freedom and the difficulty of including slow drivers such as soil moisture alongside circulation patterns. Consequently, we are going to discuss ways of adjusting the distance metric of the analog Markov chain and dimensionality reduction techniques such as EOFs and variational auto encoder. By choosing the correct combination of weighted variables in the Euclidean metric and using analogs of only 100 years and generating long synthetic sequences we are able to correctly estimate return times of order 7000 years, which is validated based on a 7200 year long control run. The teleconnection patterns generated thus also look reliable compared to the control run. Next we compare SWG forecasts of heatwaves with a direct supervised approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Both CNN and SWG are trained and validated on exactly the same GCM runs which allows us to conclude that CNN performs better in both regions. One could consider SWG as a baseline approach for CNN for this task.},

  abstract={We perform probabilistic prediction of 14 day heatwaves with the aim of comparing several data-driven approaches. The methods involve a climate emulator, a deep learning based dimensionality reduction technique and the combined approach. Since the study is methodological it relies on the data generated by an intermediate complexity climate model, which allows longer runs and includes relevant soil-atmosphere interactions. A climate emulator of temperature can be designed from resampling analogs of circulation. This corresponds to a Markov chain, with hidden states (e.g. geopotential height at 500 hPa) and equipped with the nearest analog neighbor metric, which was chosen Euclidean in the study [1]. Analog method has been successfully implemented in rare event algorithms for low dimensional climate models [2]. When applying such methods to general circulation models (GCMs) two challenges emerge: a large number of degrees of freedom and the difficulty of including slow drivers such as soil moisture alongside circulation patterns. Consequently, we are going to discuss ways of adjusting the distance metric of the analog Markov chain. The method which targets both issues is dimensionality reduction which is pursued via training a variational autoencoder [4]. Variational autoencoders approximate the probability distribution of the data and are able to draw new unseen samples. While doing so they project the state of the system to the small-dimensional latent space via a nonlinear transformation (neural network). This is achieved by minimizing the reconstruction loss with a regularization penalty which promotes Gaussian distribution on the latent space. We explore the possibility of computing nearest analog neighbors with a Euclidean metric on this latent space. This approach can be considered as complementary to the one offered by end-to-end supervised training of a neural network [3], but in addition they provide a generator of the dynamics and require much less resources than running the GCM.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks are rapidly growing foothold in Earth Sciences and elsewhere e.g. in surrogate modeling. These developments serve interests of both weather prediction and climate modeling. Among various difficulties stands reducing uncertainties in future climatologies and meteorological forecasting of extreme events such as heat waves and droughts. By nature, data is scarce for rare events, and so their study is a major challenge.
Convolutional neural network is trained on a climate model to predict heat waves. It is constructed with the goal of capturing global information coming from teleconnections of the geopotential with much more localized signal of soil moisture, which generally correlates with heat waves. The main question is to understand how much predictive information can be extracted from geophysical fields using this set-up and how this depends on the data size. Furthermore the issue of smoothness of the prediction along a given trajectory arises and is addressed with transfer learning.}

Recent extreme heat waves with huge impact are striking examples. However, they cannot be studied with conventional approaches, because they are too rare and realistic models are too complex.  We will discuss several new algorithms and theoretical approaches, based on large deviation theory, rare event simulations, and machine learning for stochastic processes, which we have specifically designed for the prediction of the committor function (the probability of the extreme event to occur). We will discuss results for the study of midlatitude extreme heat waves and demonstrate the performance of these tools. Using the best available climate models, our approach shed new light on the fluid mechanics processes which lead to extreme heat waves. We will describe quasi-stationary patterns of turbulent Rossby waves that lead to global teleconnection pattern in connection with heat waves and analyze their dynamics. We stress the relevance of these patterns for recently observed extreme heat waves with huge impact and the prediction potential of our approach.},

  abstract={Many phenomena in the climate system lie in the gray zone between weather and climate: they are not amenable to deterministic forecast, but they still depend on the initial condition. A natural example is medium-range forecasting, which is inherently probabilistic because it lies beyond the predictability time of the atmosphere. Similarly, one may ask the probability of occurrence of an El Ni√±o event several months ahead of time or the probability of occurrence of a heat wave a few weeks in advance based on the observed atmospheric circulation. In this talk, we introduce a quantity which corresponds precisely to this type of prediction problem: the committor function is the probability for an event to occur in the future, as a function of the current state of the system. In the first part of this presentation, we explain the main mathematical properties of this probabilistic concept, and compute it in the case of a low-dimensional stochastic model for El-Ni√±o, the Jin and Timmerman model. This example allows us to show that the ability to predict the probability of occurrence of the event of interest may differ strongly depending on the initial state: in some regions of phase space, the committor function is smooth (intrinsic probabilistic predictability) and in some other regions, it depends sensitively on the initial condition (intrinsic probabilistic unpredictability). We stress that this predictability concept is markedly different from the deterministic unpredictability arising because of chaotic dynamics and exponential sensivity to initial conditions. The second part of the talk is about how to efficiently compute the committor function from data through several data-driven approaches, such as direct estimates, kernel-based methods and neural networks. We discuss two examples: a) the computation of committor function for the Jin and Timmerman model, b) the computation of committor function for extreme heat waves. Both systems are highly nonlinear but, considering the dimensionality of the two, their level of complexity is profoundly different. This therefore allows us to explore and discuss the performance and limits of the different methods proposed. Finally, we propose a method for learning effective dynamics by introducing a Markov chain on the data. Using the Markov chain we are able to quickly and easily compute many interesting quantities of the original system, including the committor function. The goal is to overcome some of the limitations of the methods introduced previously and to develop a robust algorithm that can be useful even in the lack of data.},

At sufficiently small scales, one must account for many two-fluid effects, such as the ion or electron skin-depths, as well as Larmor radii. These effects occur when ignoring electron mass, for instance, is no longer possible. We are interested in studying homogeneous turbulence in the context of such plasma models. In particular, we look at a 2D extended MHD model, where the effect of electron inertia may be non-negligible . This model has been applied to understanding collisionless reconnection in past. Two-dimensional simulations are less computationally intensive and thus allow us to perform a parameter study of many runs, in which we look at the cascade of conserved quadratic quantities as we vary the effective electron skin-depth. We find that the cascade directions depend strongly on whether the length scale is relevant in the system, and, furthermore, that the transition in cascade directions happens in a critical way, as was previously observed in other studies of the kind but in different systems.},

  abstract = {In astrophysical and other applications, plasma is often in a collisionless state, where resistive and viscous effects are not important on the time/spatial scales of interest. Extended MHD (XMHD) is a one-fluid Hamiltonian theory endowed with 2-fluid effects, which are thought to be important for the formation of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei, micro-quasars, and gamma-ray bursts.  Here we consider the relativistic generalization of XMHD, obtained via an action principle (AP).  We describe covariant Poisson bracket in terms of Eulerian variables, with  constraints  implemented via the degeneracy of the Poisson bracket. Another important result is the formulation of relativistic HMHD obtained by taking a limit of the AP for XMHD.  While nonrelativistic HMHD does not have a direct mechanism for collisionless reconnection, relativistic HMHD allows the violation of the frozen-in magnetic flux condition via an electron thermal inertia effect. An alternative frozen-in flux has also been found in a manner similar to that for nonrelativistic IMHD. The scale length of the collisionless reconnection is shown to correspond to the reconnection layer width estimated by the Sweet-parker model. Finally, it is possible to pass to the nonrelativistic limit within the action itself while performing a 3+1 decomposition. This results in a bracket that is more general than the one derived earlier by Abdelhamid at al. [3], as it is valid for arbitrary electron to ion mass ratio and can be applied, for instance, to electron-positron plasmas. Further,  the Casmir invariants one obtains this way turn out to be precisely the generalized helicities, which topologically constrain possible evolution of the plasma.},

XMHD is endowed with topological invariants ‚Äì two helicities emerging from the Hamiltonian structure and useful for the Hamiltonian Energy-Casimir method [1]. In MHD turbulence the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is often invoked to explain dynamo action. However, we predict [2] analytically that the phenomenon is suppressed at the electron skin depth, i.e. it appears that the cascade reverses direction. The ongoing investigations focus on a simplified 2D case, which is more amenable to numerical analysis. The analytical queries reveal similar behavior to 3D cascade reversal so we are confident that our 2D case study should be representative.},
