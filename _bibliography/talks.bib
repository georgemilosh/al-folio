  abstract={In the climate system, extreme events or transitions between climate attractors are of primarily importance for understanding the impact of climate change. Recent extreme heat waves with huge impact are striking examples. However, they cannot be studied with conventional approaches, because they are too rare and realistic models are too complex.  We will discuss several new algorithms and theoretical approaches, based on large deviation theory, rare event simulations, and machine learning for stochastic processes, which we have specifically designed for the prediction of the committor function (the probability of the extreme event to occur). We will discuss results for the study of midlatitude extreme heat waves and demonstrate the performance of these tools. Using the best available climate models, our approach shed new light on the fluid mechanics processes which lead to extreme heat waves. We will describe quasi-stationary patterns of turbulent Rossby waves that lead to global teleconnection pattern in connection with heat waves and analyze their dynamics. We stress the relevance of these patterns for recently observed extreme heat waves with huge impact and the prediction potential of our approach.},

  abstract={Many phenomena in the climate system lie in the gray zone between weather and climate: they are not amenable to deterministic forecast, but they still depend on the initial condition. A natural example is medium-range forecasting, which is inherently probabilistic because it lies beyond the predictability time of the atmosphere. Similarly, one may ask the probability of occurrence of an El Niño event several months ahead of time or the probability of occurrence of a heat wave a few weeks in advance based on the observed atmospheric circulation. In this talk, we introduce a quantity which corresponds precisely to this type of prediction problem: the committor function is the probability for an event to occur in the future, as a function of the current state of the system. In the first part of this presentation, we explain the main mathematical properties of this probabilistic concept, and compute it in the case of a low-dimensional stochastic model for El-Niño, the Jin and Timmerman model. This example allows us to show that the ability to predict the probability of occurrence of the event of interest may differ strongly depending on the initial state: in some regions of phase space, the committor function is smooth (intrinsic probabilistic predictability) and in some other regions, it depends sensitively on the initial condition (intrinsic probabilistic unpredictability). We stress that this predictability concept is markedly different from the deterministic unpredictability arising because of chaotic dynamics and exponential sensivity to initial conditions. The second part of the talk is about how to efficiently compute the committor function from data through several data-driven approaches, such as direct estimates, kernel-based methods and neural networks. We discuss two examples: a) the computation of committor function for the Jin and Timmerman model, b) the computation of committor function for extreme heat waves. Both systems are highly nonlinear but, considering the dimensionality of the two, their level of complexity is profoundly different. This therefore allows us to explore and discuss the performance and limits of the different methods proposed. Finally, we propose a method for learning effective dynamics by introducing a Markov chain on the data. Using the Markov chain we are able to quickly and easily compute many interesting quantities of the original system, including the committor function. The goal is to overcome some of the limitations of the methods introduced previously and to develop a robust algorithm that can be useful even in the lack of data.},

  abstract={One of the big challenges today is to appropriately describe heat waves, which are relevant due to their impact on human society. Common characteristics in mid-latitudes involve meanders of the westerly flow and concomitant large anticyclonic anomalies of the geopotential field. These anomalies form the so-called teleconnection patterns, and thus it is natural to ask how robust such structures are in various models and how much data we require to make statistically significant inferences. In addition, it is natural to ask what are the precursor phenomena that would improve forecasting capabilities of the heat waves. In particular, what kind of long term effect does the soil moisture have and how it compares to the respective quantitative contribution to the predictability of the teleconnection patterns. In order to answer these questions we perform various types of regression on a climate model. We construct the composite maps of the geopotential height at 500 hPa and estimate return times of heatwaves of different severity. Of particular interest to us is a committor function, which is essentially a probability a heat wave occurs given the current state of the system. Committor functions can be efficiently computed using the analogue method, which involves learning a Markov chain that produces synthetic trajectories from the real trajectories. Alternatively they can be estimated using machine learning approach. Finally we compare the composite maps in real dynamics to the ones generated by the Markov chain and observe how well the rare events are sampled, for instance to allow extending the return time plots.},

  abstract={Astrophysical plasmas exist in a large range of length-scales throughout the universe. At sufficiently small scales, one must account for many two-fluid effects, such as the ion or electron skin-depths, as well as Larmor radii. These effects occur when ignoring electron mass, for instance, is no longer possible. We are interested in studying homogeneous turbulence in the context of such plasma models. In particular, we look at a 2D extended MHD model, where the effect of electron inertia may be non-negligible . This model has been applied to understanding collisionless reconnection in past. Two-dimensional simulations are less computationally intensive and thus allow us to perform a parameter study of many runs, in which we look at the cascade of conserved quadratic quantities as we vary the effective electron skin-depth. We find that the cascade directions depend strongly on whether the length scale is relevant in the system, and, furthermore, that the transition in cascade directions happens in a critical way, as was previously observed in other studies of the kind but in different systems.},

  abstract={There exist a wide class of systems that exhibit non-ideal effects such as Hall drift and electron inertia. The latter plays role on characteristic length scales smaller than the electron skin depth. To gain relevant understanding it is necessary to work with models such as extended MHD (XMHD) that capture these microscopic effects. XMHD is endowed with topological invariants – two helicities emerging from the Hamiltonian structure and useful for the Hamiltonian Energy-Casimir method [1]. In MHD turbulence the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is often invoked to explain dynamo action. However, we predict [2] analytically that the phenomenon is suppressed at the electron skin depth, i.e. it appears that the cascade reverses direction. The ongoing investigations focus on a simplified 2D case, which is more amenable to numerical analysis. The analytical queries reveal similar behavior to 3D cascade reversal so we are confident that our 2D case study should be representative.},

  abstract={Extended MHD, a 1-fluid model endowed with 2-fluid effects (electron inertia and Hall drift) possesses a Hamiltonian structure [1-4]. This formulation is described, as it unifies different classes of extended MHD models (including those that have mutually exclusive effects) [2]. The unification is further highlighted by showing that these models possess common topological invariants that are the generalizations of the fluid/magnetic helicity [3]. They can be expressed naturally in a knot-theoretic framework via the Jones polynomial by exploiting techniques from Chern-Simons theory. It is also shown that extended MHD exhibits other commonalities such as: generalized Kelvin circulation theorems, and the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms closely connected with generalizations of the fluid vorticity.},
