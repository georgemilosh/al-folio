  abstract = {The Summer Olympic Games in 2024 will take place during the apex of the temperature seasonal cycle in the Paris Area. The midlatitudes of the Northern hemisphere have witnessed a few intense heatwaves since the 2003 event [1]. Those heatwaves have had environmental and health impacts, which often came as surprises [2]. In this paper, we search for the most extreme heatwaves in Ile-de-France that are physically plausible, under climate change scenarios, for the decades around 2024. We circumvent the sampling limitation by applying a rare event algorithm [3] on CMIP6 data [4] to evaluate the range of such extremes. We find that the 2003 record can be exceeded by more than 4°C in Ile-de-France before 2050, with a combination of prevailing anticyclonic conditions and cutoff lows. This study intends to build awareness on those unprecedented events, against which our societies are ill-prepared. Those results could be extended to other areas of the world.},

  abstract={Understanding extreme events and their probability is key for the study of climate change impacts, risk assessment, adaptation, and the protection of living beings. In this work we develop a methodology to build forecasting models for extreme heatwaves. These models are based on convolutional neural networks, trained on extremely long 8,000-year climate model outputs. Because the relation between extreme events is intrinsically probabilistic, we emphasise probabilistic forecast and validation. We demonstrate that deep neural networks are suitable for this purpose for long lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and also at much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture). The method is easily implemented and versatile. We find that the deep neural network selects extreme heatwaves associated with a North-Hemisphere wavenumber-3 pattern. We find that the 2 meter temperature field does not contain any new useful statistical information for heatwave forecast, when added to the 500 hPa geopotential height and soil moisture fields. The main scientific message is that training deep neural networks for predicting extreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of drastic lack of data. We suggest that this is likely the case for most other applications to large scale atmosphere and climate phenomena. We discuss perspectives for dealing with the lack of data regime, for instance rare event simulations, and how transfer learning may play a role in this latter task.},

  abstract={The main goal of this article is to explore the possible sources for large-scale coherent magnetic structures that can be created in turbulent electron-proton plasmas.
We work with the model developed for applications to solar wind, which is obtained
as a fluid closure of gyrokinetic equations that describe magnetized collisionless plasmas. It can be thought of as a generalisation of magnetohydrodynamics spaning the
scales above and below the ion Larmor radius (intermediate scale), which leads to
nonlinear dispersive phenomenology of interacting kinetic Alfvén waves (KAW). The
chief quantity of interest is Generalized Cross Helicity (GCH) which measures the
energy of imbalance between the two KAW eigenmodes. At large scales they merge
with Alfvén wave branches which propagate forward and backward relative to the
magnetic field line. It was known that at large scales the cascade is forward like in
usual Kolmogorov phenomenology and there were theoretical reasons to believe the
cascade reversed sign at small scales. Using 3D numerical simulations we have found
that the inverse cascade is suppressed at intermediate scales, which leads to the formation of large elongated magnetic vortices on the Larmor scale (termed finite-scale
condensate). This is interesting since it is perhaps related to the result by another
group (Meyrand at al 2021), whereby the forward cascade in the similar system was also suppressed at
the Larmor scale. This process can potentially explain ion-kinetic spectral breaks in
plasma turbulence, and provide theory alternative to that of, where the effects of
Landau damping were phenomenologically included.
Furthermore, we study the decay instability of KAW, i.e. the decay of a pump mode
into two daughter modes, one with larger wavenumber and one with smaller. This
is resonant behavior which is possible due to the dispersive nature of KAW. Related
to these events are instabilities of the balanced state (between the two KAW eigenmodes)},

  abstract={One of the challenges involved in modeling processes in collsionless plasmas is related to their multi-scale and multi-species nature. This motivates reductions, i.e.
approximations, which are sometimes performed in an uncontrolled way, without
maintaining conservation laws. We stipulate that the conservation laws such as energy and momentum and the associated symmetries actually play a crucial role in
physics. In this paper we perform a formal asymptotic expansion and introduce the
slow manifold on which the dynamics is constrained so that electromagnetic waves
are eliminated. In particular, having in mind elimination of fast modes (electromagnetic waves), expansion of Maxwell-Vlasov system is performed and a sequence of
reduced models are derived which include: Vlasov-Poisson and Vlasov-Darwin but
also the next order expansion, which couples the transverse electromagnetic field to
the Braginskii pressure tensor and the magnetic field to the charge-weighted heat
flux tensor. The latter effect has not been considered earlier to our knowledge. One
of the possible applications for this family of models is to avoid spurious radiation
noise in Particle-in-Cell codes, which are commonly used in plasma simulations. This
would thus require discretization techniques, which can be performed directly within
the Hamiltonian action principle formalism.
In the remainder of the paper (which is more interesting for mathematical physicists)
the heuristic time scale is derived on which the state prepared on the dark slow manifold remains asymptotically close to it. In the dimensionless units the expansion depends on the small parameter that is inversely proportional to speed of light. When
the former is set to zero Vlasov-Poisson model is recovered. Straightforward truncation of the Poisson bracket may not conserve the Jacobi identity, which is a crucial
ingredient for the Hamiltonian theory. Without it Darboux’s theorem is violated and
local canonical variables may not exist. Most fundamental physical models we are
aware of satisfy Jacobi identity. Thus alternative approach is undertaken, whereby
instead of truncating Poisson bracket, which has no geometric interpretation, we
truncate the conjugate two-form Ω. This approach can be thought of as an infinite
dimensional generalization of a Lie-transform. It is infinite dimensional because our
phase space is spanned by a group of transformations of the distribution function
f (similar to Euler-Lagrange maps) as well as 3-dimensional electric E and magnetic
fields B. In a nutshell, using language of differential forms we find a coordinate-free
transformation of variables that “rectifies” symplectic two-form Ω of the dark slow
manifold onto the one of the Vlasov-Poisson system. As a consequence, Hamiltonian
and the Poisson bracket are recovered in the new coordinates, so that the new Poisson bracket is actually equivalent to the more simple one given by Vlasov-Poisson.
The resulting equations of motion are also derived. The procedure ensures that the
approximations we made preserve the sought for Hamiltonian structure.},

	abstract = {A pair of nonlinear diffusion equations in Fourier space is used to study the dynamics of strong Alfvén wave turbulence, from MHD to electron scales. Special attention is paid to the regime of imbalance between the energies of counter-propagating waves commonly observed in the solar wind (SW), especially in regions relatively close to the Sun. In the collisionless regime where dispersive effects arise at scales comparable to or larger than those where dissipation becomes effective, the imbalance produced by a given injection rate of generalized cross-helicity (GCH), which is an invariant, is much larger than in the corresponding collisional regime described by the usual (or reduced) magnetohydrodynamics. The combined effect of high imbalance and ion Landau damping induces a steep energy spectrum for the transverse magnetic field at sub-ion scales. This spectrum is consistent with observations in highly Alfvénic regions of the SW, such as trailing edges, but does not take the form of a transition range continued at smaller scales by a shallower spectrum. This suggests that the observed spectra displaying such a transition result from the superposition of contributions originating from various streams with different degrees of imbalance. Furthermore, when imbalanced energy injection is supplemented at small scales in an already fully developed turbulence, for example under the effect of magnetic reconnection, a significant enhancement of the imbalance at all scales is observed.},

We obtain an analytic perturbative expression of traveling envelope solitons by introducing a non linear Schrödinger equation for the slowly varying amplitude of short wavelength modes. Due to the non analytic properties of the dispersion relation, it is crucial to develop the theory using discrete difference operators. Those properties are also the ultimate reason why kink-solitons may exist but are unstable, at variance with the short-range FPU model.

With the first, the action is extremized under the constraints of density, entropy, and Lagrangian label conservation, which leads to a Clebsch representation for a generalized momentum and a generalized vector potential. The second action arises upon transformation to physical field variables, giving rise to a covariant bracket action principle, i.e., a variational principle in which constrained variations are generated by a degenerate Poisson bracket. Upon taking appropriate limits, the action principles lead to relativistic Hall MHD and well-known relativistic ideal MHD. For the first time, the Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic Hall MHD with electron thermal inertia (akin to Comisso et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 045001 (2014) for the electron–positron plasma) is introduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the frozen-in magnetic flux condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that does satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find the violation of the frozen-in condition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a generalized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3 + 1 Poisson bracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of the electron ion mass ratio.},

	abstract = {Recent progress regarding the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD), a model with Hall drift and electron inertia, is summarized. The advantages of the Hamiltonian approach are invoked to study some general properties of XMHD turbulence, and to compare them against their ideal MHD counterparts. For instance, the helicity flux transfer rates for XMHD are computed, and Liouville's theorem for this model is also verified. The latter is used, in conjunction with the absolute equilibrium states, to arrive at the spectra for the invariants, and to determine the direction of the cascades, e.g., generalizations of the well-known ideal MHD inverse cascade of magnetic helicity. After a similar analysis is conducted for XMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium states, a couple of interesting results emerge. When cross helicity is taken to be ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in the Hall MHD range—this is shown to be consistent with previous results in the literature. In contrast, in the inertial MHD range, viz at scales smaller than the electron skin depth, all spectral quantities are expected to undergo direct cascading. The consequences and relevance of our results in space and astrophysical plasmas are also briefly discussed.},

	journal = {{EPL} (Europhysics Letters)},
	abstract = {A family of Ising models with long-range interactions was known to have gaps in
magnetization to which no microscopic configuration corresponds. Long range systems have many other interesting statistical physics phenomena, such as ensemble
inequivalence (canonical and microcanonical) and negative specific heat to name a
few. In this letter we studied a needle-like (long) lattices of dipolar spins and we
have shown that their Hamiltonian can be mapped to aforementioned long-range
Ising model using some heuristic arguments. As such it motivates this family of Ising
models and can be considered a more physical realization thereof. Such systems can
be motivated by the experiments with some rare-earth compounds and nanoparticle
essemblies. The mapping allows us to identify phase transitions in our samples of
dipolar needles with the ones of the Ising model. These phase transitions involve ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and meta-stable states which lead to telegraph noise-type
transitions between such states in the metastable region, that we observe with direct
numerical simulations. The precise onset of the phase transitions can be determined
from the control parameters such as the length of our samples as well as the type
of lattice we use (simple cubic, face centered, body centered). The results from numerical simulations are duly compared to analytical estimates with relatively good
agreement. The overall mechanism of the transitions between different states can
be motivated by anti-ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic mean-field
coupling. We believe that the result crucially depends on the long-range nature of the
spin interaction in our system. For this we have estimated the correlation length one
would expect from a short range system, which turns out to be roughly the size of
the lattice constant, thus clearly too small. This fact suggests that the magnetization
order we observe is not of a short-range character},
