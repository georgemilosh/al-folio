  abstract={We investigate the statistics and dynamics of extreme heat waves over different areas of Europe. We find heatwaves over France and Scandinavia to be associated with recurrent wavenumber three teleconnection patterns in surface temperature and mid-tropospheric geopotential height. For heatwaves with return times of 4 years these teleconnection patterns and their dynamics are robustly represented in a hierarchy of models of different complexity and in reanalysis data. For longer return times, reanalysis records are too short to give statistically significant results, while models confirm the relevance of these large scale patterns for the most extreme heatwaves. A timeseries analysis shows that heatwave indices defined at synoptic scale are fairly well described by Gaussian stochastic processes, and that these Gaussian processes reproduce well return time plots even for very rare events. These results suggest that extreme heatwaves over different areas of Europe show recurrent typical behaviours in terms of long-range spatial correlations and subseasonal-scale temporal correlations. These properties are consistently represented among models of different complexity and observations, thus suggesting their relevance for a better understanding of the drivers and causes of the occurrence of extreme midlatitude heatwaves and their predictability.},

  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {A pair of nonlinear diffusion equations in Fourier space is used to study the dynamics of strong Alfvén wave turbulence, from MHD to electron scales. Special attention is paid to the regime of imbalance between the energies of counter-propagating waves commonly observed in the solar wind (SW), especially in regions relatively close to the Sun. In the collisionless regime where dispersive effects arise at scales comparable to or larger than those where dissipation becomes effective, the imbalance produced by a given injection rate of generalized cross-helicity (GCH), which is an invariant, is much larger than in the corresponding collisional regime described by the usual (or reduced) magnetohydrodynamics. The combined effect of high imbalance and ion Landau damping induces a steep energy spectrum for the transverse magnetic field at sub-ion scales. This spectrum is consistent with observations in highly Alfvénic regions of the SW, such as trailing edges, but does not take the form of a transition range continued at smaller scales by a shallower spectrum. This suggests that the observed spectra displaying such a transition result from the superposition of contributions originating from various streams with different degrees of imbalance. Furthermore, when imbalanced energy injection is supplemented at small scales in an already fully developed turbulence, for example under the effect of magnetic reconnection, a significant enhancement of the imbalance at all scales is observed.},

These states suggest that typically both the energy and magnetic helicity at scales shorter than the electron skin depth have a direct cascade, while at large scales the helicity has an inverse cascade as established earlier for reduced magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The calculations imply that the introduction of gyro-effects allows for the existence of negative temperature (conjugate to energy) states and the condensation of energy to the large scales.

The coupling in the linear term decays as a power-law with an exponent $1<\alpha \leqslant 3$ . We obtain an analytic perturbative expression of traveling envelope solitons by introducing a non linear Schrödinger equation for the slowly varying amplitude of short wavelength modes. Due to the non analytic properties of the dispersion relation, it is crucial to develop the theory using discrete difference operators. Those properties are also the ultimate reason why kink-solitons may exist but are unstable, at variance with the short-range FPU model. We successfully compare these approximate analytic results with numerical simulations for the value $\alpha =2$  which was chosen as a case study.},

	abstract = {Two types of Eulerian action principles for relativistic extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are formulated. With the first, the action is extremized under the constraints of density, entropy, and Lagrangian label conservation, which leads to a Clebsch representation for a generalized momentum and a generalized vector potential. The second action arises upon transformation to physical field variables, giving rise to a covariant bracket action principle, i.e., a variational principle in which constrained variations are generated by a degenerate Poisson bracket. Upon taking appropriate limits, the action principles lead to relativistic Hall MHD and well-known relativistic ideal MHD. For the first time, the Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic Hall MHD with electron thermal inertia (akin to Comisso et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 045001 (2014) for the electron–positron plasma) is introduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the frozen-in magnetic flux condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that does satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find the violation of the frozen-in condition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a generalized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3 + 1 Poisson bracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of the electron ion mass ratio.},

	abstract = {Recent progress regarding the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD), a model with Hall drift and electron inertia, is summarized. The advantages of the Hamiltonian approach are invoked to study some general properties of XMHD turbulence, and to compare them against their ideal MHD counterparts. For instance, the helicity flux transfer rates for XMHD are computed, and Liouville's theorem for this model is also verified. The latter is used, in conjunction with the absolute equilibrium states, to arrive at the spectra for the invariants, and to determine the direction of the cascades, e.g., generalizations of the well-known ideal MHD inverse cascade of magnetic helicity. After a similar analysis is conducted for XMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium states, a couple of interesting results emerge. When cross helicity is taken to be ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in the Hall MHD range—this is shown to be consistent with previous results in the literature. In contrast, in the inertial MHD range, viz at scales smaller than the electron skin depth, all spectral quantities are expected to undergo direct cascading. The consequences and relevance of our results in space and astrophysical plasmas are also briefly discussed.},

Some of the results presented include: the generalized Kelvin circulation theorems; the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms; and two concomitant helicities that can be studied via the Jones polynomial, which is widely utilized in Chern–Simons theory.

The helicities (two in all) for each of these models are obtained through these correspondences. The commonality of all the extended MHD models is traced to the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms, which are closely associated with the canonical momenta of the two underlying species. The Lie-dragging of these 2-forms by suitable velocities also leads to the correct equations of motion.

Localization in mode space is stronger for the long-range FPU model. This allows us to uncover the sporadic nature of instabilities, i.e., by varying initially the excitation amplitude of the lowest mode, which is the control parameter, instabilities occur in narrow amplitude intervals. Only for sufficiently large values of the amplitude, the system enters a permanently unstable regime. These findings also clarify the long-standing problem of the relaxation to equilibrium in the short-range FPU model. Because of the weaker localization in mode space of this latter model, the transfer of energy is retarded and relaxation occurs on a much longer timescale.},

	title = {Dipolar needles in the microcanonical ensemble: Evidence of spontaneous magnetization and ergodicity breaking},
	journal = {{EPL} (Europhysics Letters)},
	abstract = {A family of Ising models with long-range interactions was known to have gaps in
magnetization to which no microscopic configuration corresponds. Long range systems have many other interesting statistical physics phenomena, such as ensemble
inequivalence (canonical and microcanonical) and negative specific heat to name a
few. In this letter we studied a needle-like (long) lattices of dipolar spins and we
have shown that their Hamiltonian can be mapped to aforementioned long-range
Ising model using some heuristic arguments. As such it motivates this family of Ising
models and can be considered a more physical realization thereof. Such systems can
be motivated by the experiments with some rare-earth compounds and nanoparticle
essemblies. The mapping allows us to identify phase transitions in our samples of
dipolar needles with the ones of the Ising model. These phase transitions involve ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and meta-stable states which lead to telegraph noise-type
transitions between such states in the metastable region, that we observe with direct
numerical simulations. The precise onset of the phase transitions can be determined
from the control parameters such as the length of our samples as well as the type
of lattice we use (simple cubic, face centered, body centered). The results from numerical simulations are duly compared to analytical estimates with relatively good
agreement. The overall mechanism of the transitions between different states can
be motivated by anti-ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic mean-field
coupling. We believe that the result crucially depends on the long-range nature of the
spin interaction in our system. For this we have estimated the correlation length one
would expect from a short range system, which turns out to be roughly the size of
the lattice constant, thus clearly too small. This fact suggests that the magnetization
order we observe is not of a short-range character},
